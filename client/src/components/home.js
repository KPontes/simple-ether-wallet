              Ethereum blockchain network. SPW does not save passwords nor
              private keys into any backend server.

        address and private key. Print your keys information and save your your
        keys file in a safe storage. You will need your public address to access
        your balance, and to receive funds. Analogously, you will need the
        private key to sign Send Ether transactions.

        paste your mnemonic recover passphrase.

        With the unlocked wallet, you will be able to enter the destination
